READ ME

This is some horrible dirty code I knocked up to export prefixes and suffixes in a corpus to CSV files using R.
I am a total beginner.
The previous code did not work but this does.

You should put your corpus in a working directory if it is just a single file.

You need to install the R packages tau and readr

There are no bad loops or anything like that in here.

The prefixes and suffixes are 1-5 characters long. This means, if you have the prefix "super", you also get "s", "su", "sup" and "supe".

Any problems email me at marc@getgreatenglish.com
