READ ME

This is some horrible dirty code I knocked up to export prefixes and suffixes in a corpus to CSV files using R.
I am a total beginner.
You should put your corpus in a working directory if it is just a single file.

You need to install the R packages tau and readr.

There are no bad loops or anything like that in here.

The prefixes and suffixes are 1-5 characters long. This means, if you have the prefix "super", you also get "s", "su", "sup" and "supe".


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. If your corpus is not in a directory by itself, put it in a directory by itself.
2. Run affixes_1 by copying and pasting into R and pressing Enter.
3. Enter your corpus directory path.
4. Run  affixes_2 by copying and pasting into Rand pressing Enter.
5. Enter your output directory for the CSV files with your prefixes and suffixes.
6. Run affixes_3 by copying and pasting into R and pressing Enter.

UPDATES:
Run 3 files in interactive mode by copying and pasting. You get prompted for your directory for the corpus and output files.
